## Introduction

Classifying potato images as either healthy or not is important for assessing crop health and preventing the spread of diseases. This project uses a deep learning model to classify potato images based on visual features. The project also includes a Streamlit app that allows users to upload potato images and receive classification results.

## Features

- Uses a deep learning model for classifying potato images as either healthy or not.
- Provides a Streamlit app for uploading potato images and receiving classification results.
- Can handle a variety of potato images.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit App**:
    - Start the Streamlit app.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Upload Potato Image**:
    - In the app, you will be prompted to upload an image of a potato.

3. **Receive Classification**:
    - The system will classify the uploaded potato image as either healthy or not and display the result.

## Data

- The project uses a dataset of potato images labeled as either healthy or not.
- The dataset is used to train and evaluate the deep learning model.

## Deep Learning Model

- The project employs a deep learning model for classifying potato images as either healthy or not.
- The model is trained on a labeled dataset of potato images.
- The model may use architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the images.

## Code Explanation

- **app.py**:
    - The Streamlit app script for loading the deep learning model and running the image classification.
    - Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading potato images and receiving classification results.
    - Uses the trained model to classify the uploaded potato images as healthy or not.

- **training.py**:
    - The script for training the deep learning model on the potato image dataset.
    - Loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains the model.
    - Saves the trained model for later use in classification.
